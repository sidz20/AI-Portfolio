## 🔬 Featured Projects

### 🧪 Electronic Nose for Tea Quality Detection  
**Collaboration:** BRIN & Yeungnam University Korea  
**Overview:**  
Built an AI-powered system to detect tea quality using gas sensors and supervised machine learning models.

**My Role:**
- Conducted real-world sampling and pre-processing from MQ-series gas sensors
- Created and cleaned datasets for model training
- Applied classification models (KNN, SVM) using scikit-learn
- Developed a Flask-based web API for result delivery
- Designed simple frontend UI for demonstration

**Technologies:**  
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask, REST API, MQ Sensors

**Result:**  
Achieved ~85% accuracy in tea classification; model integrated into a web-based tool.

**Repository:** [🔗 GitHub Link Coming Soon]
